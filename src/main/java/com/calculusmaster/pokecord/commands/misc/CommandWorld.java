                        **Region**: The current region will influence certain Pokemon evolutions. Pokemon that are originally from the current Region will have boosted spawn rates until the Region changes!
                        Every couple of hours, the Region will change in an ordered cycle (so the next Region will be the one after the current one). 
                        If the current Region is Paldea, the next one will be Kanto, restarting the cycle.
                        
                        **Time**: The current time will also influence certain Pokemon evolutions, and has some minor effects on other things such as some Augments. Also, evolutions that require daytime will activate if the current time is Dusk (with the exception of Rockruff).
                        *Note*: The time is **not synchronized** with your timezone â€“ %s operates off of UTC-7! As a result daytime in the bot may be nighttime for you. Use `/world` to check if you're not sure!
